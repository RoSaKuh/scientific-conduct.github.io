         <h5>A Framework for Reporting the Carbon Cost of Scientific Research</h5>

         <p>The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"  target="_blank">special report </a> on the consequences of global warming to 1.5&#8451; above pre-industrial levels has made it clear that global heating poses significant and urgent threats to the sustainability of both humanity and our planet. In order to avert global catastrophe and mass extinctions it is critical that all members of society acknowledge the scale and urgency of the crisis that we face, and act immediately both to address the sustainability of our own lives and to demand meaningful responses from government and industry. We believe that the scientific community has a particular obligation, not only to contribute towards education, advocacy and effective solutions, but also to be transparent in the evaluation and mitigation of the carbon costs of our own research. To this end, we propose here a simple framework for reporting the carbon costs of research, with the hope that both individual researchers and institutions will commit to such reporting. In particular, it is hoped that in the short term such a standardised reporting framework will raise awareness of the scale of our collective impact, and promote the immediate offsetting of carbon costs, while in the longer term we hope to inspire change in the ways in which global collaborative scientific research is performed, using sustainability as a design principle.</p>

         <h6>A Standardised Reporting Table</h6>

         <p>  We, the endorsers of this proposal, commit to including a CO<sub>2</sub> reporting table such as the one below in all our future publications. This table reports in a transparent way the carbon cost of a particular research work, taking into account the cost of both computational resources and research associated travel. On this site we provide a list of all public endorsers of this proposal and if you, your research group, or your academic institution would like to make a similar public commitment, please do so via pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/scientific-conduct/scientific-conduct.github.io" target="_blank"> repository of this website</a>, or by sending a mail to <a href="#" onclick="return false;"> scientificconduct@gmail.com</a>.  In addition to including such a reporting table, we commit to offsetting the CO<sub>2</sub>-costs of our research, acknowledging this as a non-ideal temporary solution. We recognize that without institutional support such offsetting may be prohibitively expensive for individual students and researchers, and we hope that such transparent reporting provides a clear motivation of the need for institutional support in this regard.</p>

        </table> 

        <p> In order to facilitate the use of such tables, we have included a LaTex template in the resources folder of the website <a href="https://github.com/scientific-conduct/scientific-conduct.github.io" target="_blank"> repository</a>. Additionally, let's walk through an example of how to calculate all the necessary information. We begin with a description of how to calculate the total CO<sub>2</sub> cost of any computational resources which were utilized: Firstly, it is necessary to estimate the <i>total kernel hours</i> that were used. This should be available to users of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, or can be kept track of manually. Next, one should estimate the <i>thermal design power per kernel</i>. For this, you will need to find out on which kernel the simulations were conducted. The thermal design power should then be available in the manual of the manufacturer. For users of HPC systems we encourage you to reach out to your system administrators to obtain this information. Given the above information, one can calculate the <i>total energy consumption</i> (in kWh) via</p>
        <p class="centered"> [total energy consumption (kWh)] = [total kernel hours (h)] x [thermal design power per kernel (W)] x 1000  </p>
        <p class="reduced"> Next, it is necessary to find out the <i>average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions </i>(in kg/kWh) from energy production in the country in which your computational resources were located. For European countries this information, sourced from European Environmental Agency, can be found <a href="https://www.rensmart.com/Calculators/KWH-to-CO2" target="_blank"> here</a>. If you have additional data for your location, please add it to this website via a pull request! If you cannot find this information about your location or are unsure where the computations were conducted, we suggest using the global average of 0.47 kg/kWh. Finally, to calculate the <i>total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</i> (kg) of your computational resources one uses the simple formula:</p>
        <p class="centered"> [total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (kg)] = [total energy consumption (kWh)] x [average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (kg/kWh)] </p>

        <p class="reduced"> Before discussing ways in which the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from numerical simulations can be offset, let us first describe how to estimate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from research related air-travel. The first step in this regard is to list all research related flights, and we would like to suggest including flights for collaborative research visits, as well as conference attendance in fields relevant to the research work, or at which collaborators are present. Given this list of flights, one can then use <a href="https://www.atmosfair.de/en/" target="_blank"> atmosfair</a> to calculate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of each flight, and sum them together to obtain the total, which is reported in the table. Finally, at this stage we can discuss the ways in which the relevant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be offset. Once again however we want to stress that offsetting emissions <i>is not</i> a sustainable solution, and provides only a temporary strategy, which we advocate in conjunction with dedicated efforts to re-design our research process in a way that drastically reduces emissions. Again, we also acknowledge that offsetting costs may be prohibitive for individual researchers, and we hope to provide motivation to students and researchers to insist that such costs be covered by funding organizations and academic institutions. Even if it is not financially possible to offset the relevant emissions, we still encourage using the reporting table, as a method of raising awareness to this issue. In light of these caveats however, given an estimate of the total  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, if financially possible these can be easily offset using <a href="https://www.atmosfair.de/en/" target="_blank"> atmosfair</a>.</p>

        <h6>Towards Sustainable Science</h6>

        <h6>A Concluding Remark</h6>

        <p>  Our planet, and life as we know it, is in an urgent state of crisis. We believe that as scientists we have a particular obligation to acknowledge the scale and urgency of our situation, and to act in whichever ways we can to contribute towards the sustainability of our environment, both for ourselves and future generations. In order to raise awareness on these issues, and to stimulate both debate and change, we commit to transparently reporting the carbon costs of our research, offsetting these costs as a temporary strategy, and working actively in the long-term towards a sustainable mode of scientific production. In particular it is necessary that we all contribute to redesigning our own scientific process, and pressuring our funding agencies and institutions to support us in this effort. Our success relies on action as a community, and so we encourage you to make similar public commitments, and look forward to working together for the collective future of our planet. </p>
