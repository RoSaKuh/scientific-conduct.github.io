         <h5>A Framework for Reporting the Carbon Cost of Scientific Research</h5>

         <p>The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"  target="_blank">special report </a> on the consequences of global warming to 1.5&#8451; above pre-industrial levels has made it clear that global heating poses significant and urgent threats to the sustainability of both humanity and our planet. In order to avert global catastrophe and mass extinctions it is critical that all members of society acknowledge the scale and urgency of the crisis that we face, and act immediately both to address the sustainability of our own lives and to demand meaningful responses from government and industry. We believe that the scientific community has a particular obligation, not only to contribute towards education, advocacy and effective solutions, but also to be transparent in the evaluation and mitigation of the carbon costs of our own research. To this end, we propose here a simple framework for reporting the carbon costs of research, with the hope that both individual researchers and institutions will commit to such reporting. In particular, it is hoped that in the short term such a standardised reporting framework will raise awareness of the scale of our collective impact, and promote the immediate offsetting of carbon costs, while in the longer term we hope to inspire change in the ways in which global collaborative scientific research is performed, using sustainability as a design principle.</p>

         <h6>A Standardised Reporting Table</h6>

         <p>  We, the endorsers of this proposal, commit to including a CO<sub>2</sub> reporting table such as the one below in all our future publications. This table reports in a transparent way the carbon cost of a particular research work, taking into account the cost of both computational resources and research associated travel. On this site we provide a list of all public endorsers of this proposal and if you, your research group, or your academic institution would like to make a similar public commitment, please do so via pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/scientific-conduct/scientific-conduct.github.io" target="_blank"> repository of this website </a>, or by sending a mail to <a href="#" onclick="return false;"> scientificconduct@gmail.com </a>.  In addition to including such a reporting table, we commit to offsetting the CO<sub>2</sub>-costs of our research, acknowledging this as a non-ideal temporary solution. We recognize that without institutional support such offsetting may be prohibitively expensive for individual students and researchers, and we hope that such transparent reporting provides a clear motivation of the need for institutional support in this regard.</p>
